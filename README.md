## Overview
Alpha March is a multi-warehouse e-commerce platform designed to enhance shipping efficiency and reduce delivery costs. By utilizing multiple warehouses, orders are automatically routed to the nearest warehouse based on the user's address. The system offers a seamless shopping experience, with users unaware of the multi-warehouse infrastructure. Stock levels displayed to users represent the total available stock across all warehouses.

## Platform Description
### Main Features
- **Multi-Storage Support**:
  - Orders are processed by the nearest warehouse to the user's location.
  - Shipping costs are calculated based on the distance between the selected warehouse and the user's address.
- **Stock Mutation**:
  - Admins can manually request stock transfers between warehouses.
  - Automatic stock mutation is triggered when the selected warehouse lacks sufficient stock, ensuring order fulfillment.
- **Order Statuses**:
  - **Waiting for Payment**: User has created an order but has not completed payment.
  - **Awaiting Payment Confirmation**: Admin reviews the uploaded payment proof.
  - **Processing**: Order is being prepared, including any necessary stock mutations.
  - **Shipped**: Order has been dispatched to the user.
  - **Order Confirmed**: User confirms receipt of the order or it is auto-confirmed after 7 days.
  - **Cancelled**: Orders can be cancelled by the user (before payment) or by admin (refunds handled manually).
